                        text: 'Two decades ago, in 1993, Johnson Chang and Li Xianting curated the exhibition China’s New Art, Post-1989, which opened in Hong Kong in January of that year. The Chang/Li collaboration amounted to a dream team: Chang with his bilingual international cosmopolitanism, and Li with his leadership in the Chinese contemporary art world. They complemented each other through the unique perspective each of them brought. The chosen locale of Hong Kong was also significant. It was a perfect conduit, a portal for China to reach out to the world, and the world to access China. The timing was also fortuitous. After more than a decade of development, Chinese contemporary art had finally acquired a “history.” The 1993 exhibition was a milestone in that it proffered to the world a compelling art historical master narrative for Chinese contemporary art. The core of the narrative is a story of transition from the 1980s to the 1990s, and the year 1989 was a compelling divide. The set of momentous events that occurred in 1989—the end of Communism on a global scale, the tragic events in Tiananmen Square, the closing of the ‘China/Avant-garde’ experimental art exhibition in Beijing, and so forth—decidedly marked the end of a long and tumultuous decade. The 1990s saw China take on a new direction, jumping on the fast track towards the global market economy. ',

                        text: 'Thus a neat storyline presents itself. The 1980s was a decade of post-Mao thawing, marked by a breaking away from the prison-house of dogma, a new, forward-looking drive, and the emergence of a utopian aspiration toward future of modernization. The artistic language of the eighties – both of the experimental and increasingly of the academic art worlds--was largely modeled upon Euro-American Modernism. The avant-gardist fervor and stance--artists’ self-appointed mission of leading the unenlightened masses out of darkness into a liberated state—came to a crushing end in the realities of 1989.',
